## What is JustEmbed?

**JustEmbed** (LENS — Language Embedder With No Synthesizer) is an offline-first tool for **semantic search**. It runs entirely on your machine: no cloud, no API keys, no GPU required.

- **E5-Small**: General-purpose 384-dim embeddings (ONNX)
- **Custom models**: Train domain-specific models (e.g. pyrexia ↔ fever) from your text
- **Knowledge bases**: Multiple KBs, each with its own model
- **Web UI & Python API**: Use the browser or `import justembed as je`

**Version:** 0.1.1

## For Non-Technical Users

Upload documents through the web interface and search by meaning. No coding required. See how your text is chunked and embedded at each step.

## For Developers

A simple Python API lets you experiment with embeddings locally before moving to production vector databases.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install justembed
justembed begin --workspace ~/my_documents
```

Open http://localhost:5424 in your browser.
