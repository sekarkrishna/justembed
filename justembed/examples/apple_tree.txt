Our apple tree stands at the edge of the garden, leaning slightly toward the morning sun. Its branches spread wide, forming a soft canopy that changes character with every season. In spring, the tree is covered in pale blossoms that sway gently in the breeze.

By early summer, the blossoms give way to small green fruits. These apples grow slowly, absorbing sunlight and moisture from the soil. Their color deepens as the weeks pass, shifting from light green to a warm yellowish tone.

When autumn arrives, the apples reach their full size and turn a bright red. The fruit hangs heavily from the branches, and the tree becomes a favorite spot for birds looking for a sweet snack. The red apples stand out vividly against the fading leaves.

The tree itself is old but resilient. Its bark is rough, and its trunk twists in a way that tells a long story of storms and seasons. Despite its age, it continues to produce fruit every year, surprising us with its consistency.

Harvesting the apples is a small celebration in our home. We gather the red fruit in baskets, wash them carefully, and enjoy them fresh or baked into pies. The apple tree has become a symbol of patience, growth, and the quiet rewards of nature.
