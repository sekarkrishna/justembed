A urinary tract infection, commonly called a UTI, occurs when bacteria enter the urinary system. The infection often begins in the urethra and can spread upward into the bladder. Patients typically report burning sensations during urination and an urgent need to pass urine frequently.

If the infection is not treated promptly, it may reach the kidneys. This condition, known as pyelonephritis, affects the renal tissue and can cause significant discomfort. Kidney involvement often leads to flank pain, nausea, and more severe symptoms.

One of the common systemic signs of a progressing UTI is fever. A high temperature indicates that the body is responding to the infection. In medical terminology, fever is also referred to as pyrexia, and it often accompanies chills and general weakness.

Urine tests play a crucial role in diagnosing UTIs. The presence of leukocytes, nitrites, or bacteria in the urine sample helps confirm the infection. Physicians may also request imaging studies if renal complications are suspected.

Treatment usually involves antibiotics tailored to the specific bacteria causing the infection. Adequate hydration, rest, and follow-up urine tests ensure that the infection resolves completely. Early detection and proper management prevent renal damage and reduce the risk of recurrent UTIs.
